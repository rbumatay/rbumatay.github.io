### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I got to experiment with writing code for a game called Blackjack which I have never played before. I learned how to write functions for the first time and call them in my main function. Using functions for the first time made my code look more organized and readable since the main function was shortened and all the functions had distinguishable names.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite of mine because I personally enjoy art and animation, so I had fun testing out the different animations. I learned how to implement the functions from the chrono and thread header files from the C++ standard library to make the animations run smoothly. It was a fun, but rewarding challenge to see my code turn into short animations.


* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was another favorite lab of mine because it was the first time that I have created an image using code. I learned how to create an image of a smooth gradient with multiple colors using nested for loops. I also learned how to how to use the GraphicsMagick library to turn my code into a PNG image.
